# Pandas-challenge

# Description
In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

# Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

# Content Code
1. District Summary
    Total number of unique schools
    Total students
    Total budget
    Average math score
    Average reading score
    % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
    high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

2. School Summary
    Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
    Include the following:
    School name
    School type
    Total students
    Total school budget
    Per student budget
    Average math score
    Average reading score
    % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

3.Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) <!--Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order -->  

4.Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)  <!--Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order -->

5.Math Scores by Grade  <!-- the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school. -->

6.Reading Scores by Grade <!-- the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school. -->

7.Scores by School Spending <!-- calculate mean scores per spending range. -->

8.Scores by School Size   <!-- school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large). -->

9.Scores by School Type   <!-- school performance based on the "School Type". -->

10. 2 obsevables trends based on the data.
